# Normally, all that would be required to install remind would be to use the
# already packaged version provided by your Linux distribution.  On
# Debian/Ubuntu, this is usually done by typing:

  sudo apt-get install remind

# The current version of remind does not allow the desired language to be
# specified at the command-line, so, if you want to make calendars for a
# language other than your native locale, you will be required to rebuild
# remind from source.  One way of doing this is to execute the following:

  sudo apt-get install build-essential make

  mkdir -p tmp
  cd tmp

  wget http://www.roaringpenguin.com/files/download/remind-03.01.13.tar.gz.sig
  wget http://www.roaringpenguin.com/files/download/remind-03.01.13.tar.gz
  gpg --recv-key 126F42E0
  gpg --export --armor --no-emit-version --no-comment 126F42E0 >\
    126F42E0.gpg.pub.txt
  gpg --verify remind-03.01.13.tar.gz.sig remind-03.01.13.tar.gz

  tar xvfz remind-03.01.13.tar.gz
  cd remind-03.01.13
  make "LANGDEF=-DLANG=FRENCH"
  sudo cp src/remind /usr/bin/remind.fr
  sudo cp src/rem2ps /usr/bin/rem2ps.fr

  make clean
  make "LANGDEF=-DLANG=ENGLISH"
  sudo cp src/remind /usr/bin/remind.en
  sudo cp src/rem2ps /usr/bin/rem2ps.en

# Debian 7 ships with remind 03.01.12 and Ubuntu 13.10 ships with remind
# 03.01.13.  Since there may be subtle differences with the way things look
# from version to version, if you are concerned about making both an English
# and French calendar that look the same, you should probably make sure to
# build the same version of remind for all the languages for which you wish to
# make calendars.

# To perform some other operations related to generating or testing these
# calendars, you will probably also want to install some additional tools by
# typing:

  sudo apt-get install tkremind wyrd
  sudo apt-get install inkscape pdftk psutils
  sudo apt-get install libreoffice
